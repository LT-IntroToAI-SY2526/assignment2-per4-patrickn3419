# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

While completing the other tests were easy, doing the solution for the % sign was a little confusing to me. I was able to complete the first part where it would return the compenents when it was at the end of the list, but I did not know where to start on the part where I had to code what to do if the symbol was not at the end of the list. I also found it hard to give a good prompt to AI because the problem was really specific and the AI did not know what I wanted most of the time.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

The match function takes out key words that a user is looking for, such as a specific date or a specific detail on what they want (such as "who directed" or "who played in"). This allows the code to know exactly what to look for in the database, rather than trying to unscramble a large string of words.
